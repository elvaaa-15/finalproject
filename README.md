# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Mario game, version of Flappy Bird, version of Temple Run

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Angelina Gao, Haley Mandell

## Do you have any questions of your own?

N/A

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong 2.0

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets you play pong but with a twist.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will perform the game of pong with some new feautres added to it. It will have different features such as hitting a certain spot on the paddle will result in the game speeding up, along with every time the game speeds up, the colors will change. We will execute the game using the server Love by coding it in Visual Studio Code.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

1. Angelina Gao: tuk59954@temple.edu, TA: Chong Li
2. Haley Mandell: tum98602@temple.edu, TA: Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will successfully execute a basic game of Pong with no errors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will successfully execute a game of Pong with one of the features we defined with no errors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will successfully execute a game of Pong with both of the features we defined with no errors.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Through this project, we will acquire the ability to code with the love server as well as program something that involves graphics and movement. We will need to research the details of how to implement and any special functions in love as well as do a little research on the original game Pong as well. Since we are working in a group of 3, Elva will be looking into how to use Love and Haley and Angelina will research how to code Pong and as a team we will look at how to add the implementations into the game.

# Status Report

#### Your name

Elva Li

#### Your section leader's name

TA: Tamara Katic

#### Project title

Pong 2.0

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have implemented one of our features from our proposal. Every time the ball hits the paddle, the background changes to a random color.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We are still in the progress of implementing our other feature of when the ball hits the paddle, it will result in the game speeding up, increasing the level of difficulty.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One of our members have not been actively particpating in this project. However, we are working to resolve this issue.
